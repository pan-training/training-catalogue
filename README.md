The user can upload directly to Zenodo through the training catalogue.


Create Zenodo material on the catalogue                 |  Zenodo material created                   |  The material on Zenodo

### Small todos:

- Fix a size limit for the file.  

- ~~Make it possible to upload multiple files at the same time, not just a single one. ~~ Make it prettier and more intuitive now.

- ~~Add a disclaimer explaining that uploading through Zenodo will offer more fields. The Zenodo seamless upload feature is made for quick/fast uploads.~~

- ~~Indicate which fields are mandatory with an asterisk.~~

- ~~Add text explanations for some fields.~~

- ~~Add concerns checks for the newly created lists (see has_licence as an already existing example).~~

- ~~Indicate which fields zenodo takes into account with colours.~~

- ~~The second type for image and publication does not work if not manually selected, probably something to do with no default existing.~~

### Big todos:

- Check the text and the description before an upload to make sure it isn't spam.

- Add editing.

- Change the "delete" button to "delete from training catalogue". Explain that it is not possible to delete a published material on Zenodo. 

### In the near(ish) future:

- Create a slightly different system where the API key used is the user's. This is a more resilient system. This system can use most everything done here, but a slight tweak to add the user's api key instead of our own needs to be implemented. Both possible systems could co-exist at the same time and the user could chose which one he/she wants to use.
