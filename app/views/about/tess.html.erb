        <p>One of the goals of <%= link_to 'ExPaNDS', 'https://expands.eu', target: '_blank' %>
        (European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) Photon and Neutron Data Service) is to train research scientists to 
        better use available computational RI infrastructures to address critical research questions. 
        This requires access both to face-to-face training opportunities and to disparate training materials 
        and resources, currently dispersed across Europe.</p>

        <p>Our training catalogue <a href="https://pan-training.eu" target="_blank">pan-training.eu</a>, provids a one-stop shop for trainersand trainees to discover
          online information and content, including training materials, events and interactive tutorials.
          the catalogue provides opportunities to promote training events and news, and to contribute
          to a growing catalogue of materials; for trainers, the portal offers an environment for sharing materials
          and event information; for trainees, it offers a convenient gateway via which to identify relevant training
          events and resources, and to perform specific, guided analysis tasks via customised training workflows to provide FAIR research.</p></br>

        <p>Our associated e-learning platform hosts free education and training for scientists and students with an integration of Jupyter notebooks. The purpose of PaN-training's e-learning platform is to provide open source neutron, photon and muon science training to European scientists and students. The e-learning platform itself started out as e-neutrons.org. It was developed primarily by Copenhagen University as a means to teach their own students about neutrons science. The platform was developed and integrated as our e-Learning branch at <a href="https://e-learning.pan-training.eu" target="_blank">e-learning.pan-training.eu</a> by our sister Project <a href="https://www.panosc.eu/" target="_blank">PaNOSC</a></p>

            These primarily take the form of workshops, courses, webinars, etc.; but our training catalogue also collects information about
            conferences, meetings and hackathons, as these may also provide opportunities for learning.</p>

              <p>An essential feature in our training catalogue are graphical training tools termed 'Training Workflows'. Three main types of workflow are
                in intended: Educational Resources, Learning Pathways and Experiment Maps. These encapsulate different
                types of, and/or approaches to, training, at different levels of granularity, within easy-to-use visual
                displays.</p>

          <div class="sub-about-block">
            <div class="h5">Learning Paths</div>
            <p>In order to advance their skills, trainees need to embark on a path, or developmental trajectory. To
              facilitate this journey, learning paths aim to structure, within simple visual workflows, the set of
              relevant training resources that trainees need to study in order to accomplish their learning objectives.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="sub-about-block">
            <div class="h5">Experiment Maps</div>
            <p>ExPaNDS and PaNOSC developed several registries that contain and promote a variety of resources that users can
              exploit: training resources in our catalogue; software tools; various data repositories with experiment data and 
              workflows, standards and policies. Experiment maps provide visual overviews
              of typical data-analysis pipelines, surfacing the relevant tools and databases from these registries,
              and showing how they fit together. Experiment maps are being developed by HZDR and Soleil.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="sub-about-block">
            <div class="h5">Educational Resource</div>
              <p>In this type of workflow, trainees are introduced to various practical tasks, linked to associated
                online tools and/or databases, within self-contained modules. Each module includes i) succinct statements
                of teaching goals and learning outcomes, to convey to trainees what they will be able to do on completion
                of the module; ii) a series of questions or ‘Reflections’ to provoke critical thinking about the tasks
                that have been completed; iii) additional background information and further reading to help support
                learning and enquiry; and iv) multiple choice quiz questions to evaluate understanding at the end.
