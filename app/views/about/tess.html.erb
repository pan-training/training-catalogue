        <p>One of the goals of <%= link_to 'ELIXIR', 'https://elixir-europe.org', target: '_blank' %>
        (Europe's distributed infrastructure for life-science data) is to train research scientists to better use
        available computational infrastructures to address critical research questions. This requires access both to
        face-to-face training opportunities and to disparate training materials and resources, currently dispersed
          across Europe.</p>

        <p>TeSS is ELIXIR's training platform, providing a one-stop shop for trainersand trainees to discover
          online information and content, including training materials, events and interactive tutorials.
          For ELIXIR Nodes, TeSS provides opportunities to promote training events and news, and to contribute
          to a growing catalogue of materials; for trainers, the portal offers an environment for sharing materials
          and event information; for trainees, it offers a convenient gateway via which to identify relevant training
          events and resources, and to perform specific, guided analysis tasks via customised training workflows</p>

           <p>Events in TeSS are defined as face-to-face or online training opportunities that have set start and end times.
            These primarily take the form of workshops, courses, webinars, etc.; but TeSS also collects information about
            conferences, meetings and hackathons, as these may also provide opportunities for learning.</p>
            <p>
              A significant portion of TeSS' initial content was contributed by the progenitor event-announcement platform,
              <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23742982" target="_blank">iAnn.pro</a>.

              <p>New to TeSS are graphical training tools termed 'Training Workflows'. Three main types of workflow are
                in development: Educational Resources, Learning Pathways and Concept Maps. These encapsulate different
                types of, and/or approaches to, training, at different levels of granularity, within easy-to-use visual
                displays.</p>

            <div class="h5">Learning Paths</div>
            <p>In order to advance their skills, trainees need to embark on a path, or developmental trajectory. To
              facilitate this journey, learning paths aim to structure, within simple visual workflows, the set of
              relevant training resources that trainees need to study in order to accomplish their learning objectives.
              Learning paths are being developed by ELIXIR TeSS, ELIXIR-NL and ELIXIR UK.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="sub-about-block">
            <div class="h5">Concept Maps</div>
            <p>ELIXIR has developed several registries that contain and promote a variety of resources that users can
              exploit: training resources in TeSS; software tools in
              <a href="https://bio.tools" target="_blank">bio.tools</a>; databases, standards and policies in
              <a href="https://fairsharing.org" target="_blank">FAIRsharing</a>. Concept maps provide visual overviews
              of typical data-analysis pipelines, surfacing the relevant tools and databases from these registries,
              and showing how they fit together. Concept maps are being developed by ELIXIR TeSS, ELIXIR-EE and
              ELIXIR-BE.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="sub-about-block">
            <div class="h5">Educational Resource</div>
              <p>In this type of workflow, trainees are introduced to various practical tasks, linked to associated
                online tools and/or databases, within self-contained modules. Each module includes i) succinct statements
                of teaching goals and learning outcomes, to convey to trainees what they will be able to do on completion
                of the module; ii) a series of questions or ‘Reflections’ to provoke critical thinking about the tasks
                that have been completed; iii) additional background information and further reading to help support
                learning and enquiry; and iv) multiple choice quiz questions to evaluate understanding at the end.
                Educational Resources for introductory sequence and structural bioinformatics are currently being
                developed by ELIXIR TeSS, ELIXIR-UK and the UK Structural Bioinformatics group
                (via the FunPDBe project).</p>
