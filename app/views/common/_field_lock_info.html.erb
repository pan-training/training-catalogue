    <p>Much of the content in our ExPaNDS/PaNOSC Training Catalogue is retrieved and kept up-to-date via automated scrapers that pull information
      from public web pages and APIs in regular intervals.</p>

    <p>To prevent the ExPaNDS/PaNOSC Training Catalogue from overwriting a field you have changed, click the
      <i class="fa fa-unlock field-lock-example-open" aria-hidden="true"></i> icon to lock the field.</p>

    <p>Fields marked as <i class="fa fa-lock field-lock-example-locked" aria-hidden="true"></i> will not be overwritten.</p>
